This `styles-m` was broken and did not affect the website's appearance before my fixes:
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/1
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/2
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/3
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/4
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/5
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/6
https://github.com/clinessentials/core/issues/7
After the fixes, the file became valid and became affect the website's appearance,
so I have disabled it in `vendor/magento/theme-frontend-blank/Magento_Theme/layout/default_head_blocks.xml`.
I need to include my CSS manually, because `styles-l.css` is included with the rule:
`<css src="css/styles-l.css" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"/>`
so it is not applied for screens narrower than 768px. -->
	<head><css src='ClinEssentials_Core::main.css'/></head>
